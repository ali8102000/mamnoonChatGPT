# Architecture

- Resolve technician service illustrations through the shared slug-to-asset registry with an illustrated fallback, so selection and summary displays stay consistent.
- Database schema lives in `drizzle/migrations` (consolidated from the imported project); add changes as new migrations, never edit applied ones.
- Admin/staff checks run in database functions (`has_staff_role`, `has_admin_access`, `is_super_admin`, `assert_staff`); server functions call them before using the privileged client, so never query `client.server` from route components.
- User-linked tables reference `public.profiles(id)` so admin views can embed profile names via `<table>_<column>_fkey`.
- Phone-only accounts sign in with a synthetic `phone<digits>@mamnoon.app` email, which is why email auto-confirm stays on.
- Subscription expiry runs as a daily database job calling `handle_expired_subscriptions()`; it replaced the old scheduled function.
- Keep the welcome flow in `/welcome` with browser-persisted language preferences; language selection covers welcome and auth screens.
- Governorate-scoped place search uses one bounded Google Text Search request with local administrative-polygon filtering, never nearest-city classification or per-result requests, to exclude neighboring provinces without fan-out.
- Taxi prices and submission require a confirmed destination and successful Google driving-route distance; unavailable routes must never receive approximate or minimum-only placeholder prices.
- Taxi dispatch is database-triggered and uses a bounded timed queue with wake-on-enqueue and unschedule-on-drain, so expiry and widening work when client screens are closed; acceptance validates pending offers and their deadlines atomically.
- Route warning and error toasts through the shared Arabic translator; never display raw provider or database error text to users.
- Full-screen live maps render through a body portal with explicit close controls; this avoids parent layout clipping, and navigation actions stay in provider views only.
- Never list `.env` in `.gitignore`: published builds read the public backend URL/key from the committed file, and ignoring it ships a client that cannot connect.
- Available drivers/technicians publish idle location to `provider_presence` from the app shell; nearby-driver matching and map pins read it, because per-request `live_locations` only exist after acceptance.
